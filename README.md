## Summary
Forecasting the highly volatile stock market is a significant computing challenge due to its erratic nature. Investors often face the risk of selling shares at inopportune times due to market unrest. While precise prediction is very difficult to attain, leveraging historical data analysis and machine learning techniques can help minimize losses. This project proposes to bridge the gap between financial market sentiment and stock price movements by combining the sentiment analysis on social media data with historical stock data from Yahoo Finance with an aim to determine if user sentiments have a notable impact on changes in the stock market.
